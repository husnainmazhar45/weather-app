# weather-app
Project Description:
The Weather App is a web application that allows users to get weather information based on a city name. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and displays it. The application provides a clean and professional design with Bootstrap for styling.

How to Run the Project Locally:
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Performance Summary:
The Weather App leverages AJAX to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API without reloading the page. The use of asynchronous requests ensures a smooth user experience, and the loading icon provides feedback during data retrieval.

Challenges Faced and Solutions:
Styling and Icons:
Challenge: Achieving a professional look.
Solution: Integrated Bootstrap for styling.
API Key Handling:
Challenge: Properly managing and securing the OpenWeatherMap API key.
Solution: Stored the API key securely and ensured it is not exposed in the public repository.
